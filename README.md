# Air-Quality-Index--Saudi-Arabia

📌 Insight Summary: Air Quality Dashboard
This dashboard provides a holistic view of air pollution dynamics across the selected period (2004–2005). The visual analytics uncover critical patterns in pollutant behavior, environmental correlations, and emission contributions.

🟠 1. Air Quality Index (AQI) vs WHO Standards
Observed AQI: 61.16

WHO Recommended Limit: 35.40

Insight: The average AQI exceeds WHO guidelines by ~73%, indicating a significant health risk for prolonged exposure. The red KPI visualization highlights the urgency of intervention.

📉 2. Daily Trends in Major Pollutants
Pollutants Tracked: NO₂, PM2.5, NOx, PM10

Observation: NOx and NO₂ show higher variability and peaks, suggesting potential links to traffic congestion or industrial cycles.

PM2.5 & PM10: Steady but elevated, indicating consistent particulate pollution likely from combustion or construction.

🧩 3. Correlation Analyses
📍 Temperature vs PM2.5:

Trend: Positive correlation

Interpretation: Higher temperatures may trap pollutants due to thermal inversions or contribute to secondary pollutant formation (e.g., ozone).

Implication: Pollution mitigation policies must consider seasonal temperature effects.

📍 Wind Speed vs Pollution:

Trend: Weak or no clear correlation

Interpretation: Localized emission sources or geographic barriers may be limiting pollutant dispersion, even at higher wind speeds.

Recommendation: Study local topography and urban layout for airflow bottlenecks.

🧭 4. Emission Source Contribution
Top Sources:

Industrial: 21.29%

Vehicular: 15.09%

Biomass Burning: Moderate to low contributions

Insight: Industrial activities are the leading contributors to pollution, necessitating emission controls, cleaner technologies, or zoning enforcement.

Actionable Steps: Implement stricter compliance measures and introduce vehicle emission standards or alternative fuels.

📅 5. Temperature and Pollution Over Time
Pattern: Parallel fluctuation patterns indicate possible causal or compounding relationships between temperature and pollution spikes.

Insight: Suggests environmental monitoring and alerts could be optimized using weather forecasting models.


📌 Key Takeaways
Air quality is consistently above safe levels.

Industrial and vehicular sources are the primary contributors.

Temperature increases correlate with worsening PM2.5 levels.

Wind speed is not a major dispersal factor, indicating localized buildup.

Policy should focus on industrial emission control, transportation reform, and temperature-aware pollution forecasting.
